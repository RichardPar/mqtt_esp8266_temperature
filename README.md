This is a simple MQTT temperature reader that connects to a Mosquitto Broker
Arduino code uses the ESP2688 Wifi module and published

SENSOR/[IP]/TEMPERATURE
SENSOR/[IP]/TEMPERATURE2
SENSOR/[IP]/HUMIDITY
(Temperature2 and Humidity are from a DHT22 Sensor)

DS18x20 temperature sensor is connected to D4 and DHT22 on pin D3
